# Test Examples

Sample path test project with some scenarios using defined steps at Golium and creating new ones.

## Structure

The examples folder contains the following directories:

- `features`. Features for the test suite in BDD.
- `environments`. It contains the configuration for each environment in a specific yml file. This directory is configured with the environment variable: `DIR_ENVIRONMENTS`.
- `schemas`. JSON schemas. This is used by some steps to validate an input (e.g. the HTTP response body). This directory is configured with the environment variable: `DIR_SCHEMAS`.
- `logs`. It stores the log files generated by the execution of the suite tests.
- `steps`. New steps added using Golium as dependency sharing data between them.

## Testing

For testing:

```shell
cd test/acceptance
go test -v
```

Run specific tag `@shared` from feature file:

```shell
go test -v --godog.tags="shared"
```
