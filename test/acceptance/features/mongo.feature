Feature: MongoDB client
     Examples of MongoDB access and data processing. It is possible to:
  - Creation of documents.
  - Deletion of documents.
  - Checking the number of documents.
  - Verification of the existence or not of the _id in the documents.
  - Checking the existence or not of certain data in documents (texts, numbers, booleans, lists, objects).
  - Checking the existence or not of fields in the collection.
  - Checking null, empty and non-existent values.


  Background:
    # Prepare data: Collection "example" empty and create "_id" field
    Given I connect to MongoDB
      | field      | value                  |
      | User       | [CONF:mongoUsername]   |
      | Password   | [CONF:mongoPassword]   |
      | Host       | [CONF:mongoHost]       |
      | AuthSource | [CONF:mongoAuthSource] |
      | Database   | [CONF:mongoDatabase]   |
    And I delete all documents from the MongoDB "example" collection
    And I check that the number of documents in collection "example" is "0"
    And I generate a UUID and store it


  @mongodb
  Scenario: Create a collection, check it and delete it.
    Given I create "2" documents in the MongoDB "test-colection" collection
    Then I check that the number of documents in collection "test-colection" is "2"
    When I delete documents from the MongoDB "test-colection" collection whose "fieldString" field is "Example field string 1" value
    Then I check that the number of documents in collection "test-colection" is "1"
    When I delete documents from the MongoDB "test-colection" collection whose "fieldString" field is "Example field string 2" value
    Then I check that the number of documents in collection "test-colection" is "0"

    # Delete a document by searching for a string element in a map
    When I delete documents from the MongoDB "example" collection whose "fieldMap.fieldString" field is "Example field in map string 4" value

    When I delete documents from the MongoDB "example" collection whose "fieldMap.fieldInt" field is "50" value
    Then I check that the number of documents in collection "example" is "5"
    # Delete a document by searching for a string element on a map within another map
    When I delete documents from the MongoDB "example" collection whose "fieldMap.fieldMap2.fieldString" field is "Example field in map map string 6" value
    Then I check that the number of documents in collection "example" is "4"
    # Delete a document by searching for an int element on a map within another map
    When I delete documents from the MongoDB "example" collection whose "fieldMap.fieldMap2.fieldInt" field is "700" value

  @mongodb
  Scenario: Check that there is some data in the "example" collection through a table in the feature
    Given I create "1" documents in the MongoDB "example" collection
